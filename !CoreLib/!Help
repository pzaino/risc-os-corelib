_ Release 1.0.0 rc 1 _

-  DISCLAIMER  -
-----------------------

This is a library I wrote many years ago to make my life easier
when coding in C on RISC OS on my RiscPC. It is not meant to be
something as complete as UnixLib and the GCC project, instead is a simple ANSI C99 library that re-implements all typical
RISC OS SWIs as a POSIX-like library making it more intuitive
to use the RISC OS API and also somewhat more reliable given
the library does quite a bit of arguments check that RISC OS
SWI API doesn't do.

Thanks for using my Open Source work, and, most of all, thanks for coding on RISC OS :)
